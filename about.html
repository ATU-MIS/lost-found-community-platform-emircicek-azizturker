    <h1>About Lost & Found Community</h1>

    <p>
        Lost & Found Community is a community-driven platform designed to help
        people reconnect with their lost belongings and return found items to
        their rightful owners.
    </p>

    <p>
        The platform brings together students, staff, and community members in
        a single space where lost and found items can be reported, searched, and
        claimed easily. By encouraging cooperation and responsibility, the
        system helps reduce permanent losses and strengthens trust within the
        community.
    </p>

    <p>
        Users can post lost item reports with detailed location and time
        information, browse found items, and securely contact each other through
        the system. The goal is to make the recovery process fast, transparent,
        and accessible for everyone.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lost & Found Community promotes social responsibility, collaboration,
        and digital accessibility by providing a simple and modern interface
        that works across devices.
